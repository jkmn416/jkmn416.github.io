Some will observe from a safe distance, while others will risk it all to get the perfect shot of a violent tornado from close range. Whether you're out there deploying data-collecting probes, intercepting in an armored vehicle, or just taking pictures, you're bound to have a run in with mother nature like no other. Just watch yourself, sometimes the hunters become the hunted. \n\nConnect with us through our social links (below this), where you can talk to others about the game, view change logs, announcements, and make suggestions.\n\nDevelopers:\nWillzuh - Builder\nSiryzm - Programmer\n\nSpecial thanks to our contributors for making this possible!",

        "Description": "🎲 Double Down is a donation game where you can earn Robux by hosting minigames. The more games you host, the more Robux you can earn!\n\n🤔 How to Play:\n- First, buy a ticket with Robux to host a minigame.\n- Then, wait for an opponent. They pay you Robux for a ticket to join.\n- Finally, battle!\n    - The winner can host a new minigame for FREE as a reward for performance. \n\n🌟 Free minigames are how you earn Robux: you pay nothing while you opponent pays you. Now that's profit!\n\n📝 Double Down is not against Roblox's Community Standards because 1) selling access to games is allowed, 2) items can never be exchanged for Robux, and 3) getting a ticket for winning is SOLELY for performance. Players spending Robux understand they are only guaranteed access to play minigames. See the Terms and Conditions ingame for more information.\n\n⌛Your Robux: https://www.roblox.com/transactions\n\nTags: Donate, Pls, Hangout, Judge, Spin, Social, Avatar, Dono, Roleplay",

Experience and survive a sinking ship in a way you've never experienced before!\n\nJust to be clear, the \"realistic\" part refers to the fact that rooms can flood separately.\n\ncool features:\n-Air pockets!\n-Opening doors will cause the room to flood if there is water outside the room!\n-Glass and Doors can sometimes break under water pressure, causing an unstoppable rush of water so beware!\n-You can toggle the walls and underwater fog in the settings to see the water level physics clearly in action!\n-The ship may sink a little faster the more rooms that are flooded!\n\nTechnical:\nHaving realistic terrain water is not possible because terrain water is \"voxel-based\" and plus will just cause more lag. Blocky water is all we can get for now but other than that, enjoy those glorious physics and air pockets!\n\nUntitled Game\nSaturday, April 20 2024, 6:30:03 PM",

Each step you take is like a secret, where you can’t see the ground but you know it's there. You trust your feet to find the way. As you walk, the air sparkles with tiny lights, making you feel excited. The sky changes to show beautiful colors, and you know you’re getting closer to the rainbow area. When you finally get there, everything around you bursts into bright, happy colors, just like a real rainbow, making you feel like you’re in a fairy tale. The hidden path leads to a place full of amazing beauty and fun. Doing a hard obstacle course, or obby, can be really challenging but also super fun! You have to climb, jump, and balance on all sorts of tricky parts. Sometimes you might fall, but you get back up and try again. Each time you get a little better and move a little farther. You might have to cross wobbly bridges, dodge swinging balls, or crawl through tunnels.",
